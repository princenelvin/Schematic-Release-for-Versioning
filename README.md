1. Install the semantic-release on your local environment:
    npm install --save-dev semantic-release
    $ npm install semantic-release @semantic-release/git @semantic-release/github -D

   2. Create a config file (release.config.js) in the project with the contents below:
     release.config.js
    ====================

module.exports = {
   branches: "main",
   repositoryUrl: "https://github.com/<yourname>/actionstest.git",
   plugins: [
     '@semantic-release/commit-analyzer',
     '@semantic-release/release-notes-generator',
     '@semantic-release/git',
     '@semantic-release/github']
}

3. Add your project to the repo:
       git add .
